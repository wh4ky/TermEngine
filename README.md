## About

TermEngine (TE for short) is an engine which allows you to display and maybe make games in the terminal with [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) and [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).

## Soon™

- Something I won't abandon.
- GameObjects (objects that contain all data needed for displaying, moving, ect.)
- 3D rendering with OpenCL.
- Lua bindings.

## Aim Of The Game

I want TE to be fully compatible with the TTY on unix systems.
