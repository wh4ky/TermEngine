## About

Whacky Engine is an engine which allows you to do stuff on the terminal with [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) and [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code).

## Future Development

- Something I won't abandon (optional).  
- Shapes
- More optimized rendering

## How to use

Copy all of the header files from the [lib](./lib/) directory include `all.h` in your program.
`all.h` includes all the header files, so you don't need to worry about including all the separate header files one-by-one.  
Read the [documentation](./docs/DOCS.md).
